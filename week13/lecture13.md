# Today

1. Framing devices and techniques
2. Design for interactivity vs static
3. Guided vs unguided

---

## Framing Devices

Think of a video game, or a movie, where someone was introduced to something.

---

## Framing Devices

What do framing devices provide?

 * Context
 * Stability
 * Orientation

---

## Framing Devices: Context

<iframe seamless="seamless" style="width: 100%; border: none; display: block; max-width: 768px; height: 600px;" src="https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/embed/cc875f97-6042-4c9b-861a-614c32cc08f2?autoplay=false"> </iframe>

---

## Framing Devices: Stability

## Framing Devices: Orientation

## Storytelling Form

 * Narrative
 * Navigable
 * Hybrid

---

## Style of Story: Navigable

Do we give the person control?  How much control?  What do we need to retain?

<ul>
 <li class="fragment"><b>Causality</b>: Do we want to start <i>en media res</i>? Are we just a bunch of events that happen to occur?</li>
 <li class="fragment"><b>Control</b>: How many degrees of freedom do we provide? When does it become confusing?  Is it sequential, random access, or a hybrid?</li>
 <li class="fragment"><b>Connection</b>: Does the experience (the teller) enable a connection between the data (the tale) and the viewer (the told)?</li>
</ul>

---

## Style of Story: Static

Things sit there.  People can explore with their eyes, but the reference points never change under their feet.

These can be effective, but can also be less visceral.

---

## Style of Story: Hybrid

A large-scale progression, coupled with intermediate diagrams that may be navigable.

---

## Style of Story: Examples

 * Plague, Inc
 * [Bloomberg 50](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2019-bloomberg-50/)
 * [Figures in the Sky](http://www.datasketch.es/may/code/nadieh/) (and [write-up](https://www.visualcinnamon.com/portfolio/figures-in-the-stars))
 * [Selfie City](http://selfiecity.net/)
 * [Letter Frequency](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/gallery/frequency-letters)
 * [Legend of Nixon](https://twotone.io/examples/legend-of-nixon/)

## Designing Your Story

 1. What medium will you use?
    * How do you want people to "consume" it?
    * What are the pre-requisites?
    * What do you need to do to prepare it?
 2. What should it look like?
    * How "risky" should it be?
    * Is there a "visual language" you could use?
 3. Where are the dimensions?
    * What can change?
    * What can stay the same?
    * What can the audience control, and what can they not?

## You Can Do This

<p class="fragment">Yes, you can do this.</p>

<p class="fragment">Even the stuff that seems super technical and complicated.</p>

<p class="fragment">I wouldn't say this if it weren't true.</p>

---

## Resources

<ul>
<li class="fragment">There are tutorials out there.  Use these.</li>
<li class="fragment">Use templates.  Make them your own.</li>
<li class="fragment">Learn from others.  Ask questions.</li>
<li class="fragment">Find the fun things.</li>
<li class="fragment">Use stuff like <a href="https://iodide.io">iodide</a>, <a href="https://observablehq.com/">observable</a>, <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/">safari</a>, <a href="https://github.com/">github</a>, and especially <a href="https://glitch.com/">glitch</a>.
</ul>

## Bonus: Developing a Data Story

Let me tell you a story, about me telling myself a story.

## This Story: Why?

You can play this game on [the internet archive](https://archive.org/details/msdos_The_Summoning_1992).
(The [manual](https://ia902608.us.archive.org/6/items/vgmuseum_ssi_summoning-manual/summoning-manual.pdf) might help.)

But I don't really want to play the game.  I've been there.  I want to understand it.

## This Story: Starting Out

Let's talk about [kaitai.io](https://kaitai.io) and how files are stored.  And then, let's talk about how we might turn this into a data story?
