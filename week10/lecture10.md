## Finding the story

 > "But the numbers keep on circling me..."

Let's talk about explaining things.

---

## How do we tell stories?

 * Teller
 * Tale
 * Told

## Data Stories

Where does the data fit into this?

Where does the interaction fit into this?

---

## Informing versus Driving

Do you want your audience to be able to recreate your input data?  To make inferences?  Or is it appropriate to focus on conveying broad ideas, without one-to-one mapping of information to visualization?

Our stories must be *honest*.

---

## Choosing a Medium

 * Will you be there?
 * How constrained is your story?
 * What technical abilities do you have?
 * How does the data interact?

---

## Technical Choices

[Explorables explanations](https://explorabl.es/) has a collection of [tools](https://explorabl.es/tools/) we can explore.

---

## Kinetic Graphs

https://kineticgraphs.org/

By defining specific characteristics, mathematical formulas can be manipulated simply.

---

## Observable

We used this last week, and we will again!

---

## Github Pages

How can we deploy this on Github Pages?

---

## Glitch

Glitch.com is an environment for exploration of web development and applications.

---

# Data Sources

Divide into groups.  Explore:

 * data.world
 * data.gov
 * data.illinois.gov
 * data.humdata.org

Prepare an introduction to between one and three datasets you identify that you

 * What format is the data in?
 * What is the type of data (rows, columns, connectivity, etc)
 * What story might be hidden?
